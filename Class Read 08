Computer Network - AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting)

Explain each of the three A’s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story.

AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) – 
AAA is a standard-based framework used to control who is permitted to use network resources (through authentication), 
what they are authorized to do (through authorization), and capture the actions performed while accessing the network (through accounting). 

Authentication- Is checking if someone trying to use the network is allowed by asking for a username and password. 
Network admins decide how this check happens, like using a device's own list of users or asking an outside server. They use lists to pick how to do this check.

Authorization- Decides what a user can do once they're allowed on the network. For instance, a junior engineer might only get access to certain commands.
Admins use lists to set these limits, either on the device or through an outside server.

Accounting- Keeps track of what users do on the network, like which events they trigger and how long they stay connected. 
Admins make lists to decide what to track and where to send those records.

What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?

If the ACS server fails to authenticate, the administrator should mention using the local database of the device as a backup, in the method list, to implement AAA.

What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram.

RADIUS Concepts

What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?

Centralized Management: Manage multiple logins and access across systems using one set of credentials.
Security: Strong authentication protocols and encryption keep data safe.
Scalability: Handles a large number of users and devices effectively.
Authorization Control: Sets user permissions and access policies.
Logging and Accountability: Keeps track of user activity for auditing and troubleshooting.
Compatibility: Works well with various network devices.
Reduced Network Load: Optimizes traffic by consolidating authentication requests.
Reliability: Supports failover and redundancy for uninterrupted access control.


What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) 
Is a client-server protocol and software that enables remote access servers to communicate with a central server to authenticate dial-in users and authorize their access to the requested system or service.

Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?
RADIUS uses encryption like MD5, SHA-1/SHA-2, and TLS to secure data and messages during authentication and communication between devices. 
These algorithms protect against unauthorized access and tampering. EAP methods, like TLS and TTLS, also incorporate various cryptographic techniques within RADIUS.
