How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public?
A VPC will have a dedicated subnet and VLAN that are only accessible by the VPC customer. 
This prevents anyone else within the public cloud from accessing computing resources within the VPC â€“ effectively placing the "Reserved" sign on the table. 
The VPC customer connects via VPN to their VPC, so that data passing into and out of the VPC is not visible to other public cloud users.

What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part?

Public Subnets:

Internet Gateway: This allows communication between instances in the VPC and the internet, often located in a public subnet.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): It distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances and typically resides in a public subnet to receive external traffic.
Bastion Hosts or Jump Boxes: Instances that allow secure access to private instances via SSH or RDP, placed in a public subnet to facilitate external access.
Public-Facing Application Servers: Instances hosting public services like websites or APIs accessible from the internet.
Public Databases with Restricted Access: Some databases might reside in public subnets but are configured with strict security groups to limit access only to specific IP addresses or resources.
Private Subnets:

Application Servers and Backend Services: Instances that handle sensitive data or perform backend tasks that don't require direct internet access.
Database Servers: Instances running databases like Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, or other database systems that don't need direct external access and are placed in private subnets for security.
Internal APIs and Microservices: Services or APIs used internally within your infrastructure that don't need external exposure.
Elasticache for Private Use: Services like Redis or Memcached used for caching purposes within the VPC and not intended for direct external access.
Other Internal Resources: Various services, such as batch processing servers, application components, or analytics tools, that operate within the internal network and do not require public access.

What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure?

Scalability: Because a VPC is hosted by a public cloud provider, customers can add more computing resources on demand.
Easy hybrid cloud deployment: It's relatively simple to connect a VPC to a public cloud or to on-premises infrastructure via the VPN. 
Better performance: Cloud-hosted websites and applications typically perform better than those hosted on local on-premises servers.
Better security: The public cloud providers that offer VPCs often have more resources for updating and maintaining the infrastructure, especially for small and mid-market businesses. 
For large enterprises or any companies that face extremely tight data security regulations, this is less of an advantage.
