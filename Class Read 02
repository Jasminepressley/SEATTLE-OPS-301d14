1.What is a port? Describe it with an analogy that would help a family member understand.
A port scanner is a computer program that checks network ports for one of three possible statuses – open, closed, or filtered.

 -Imagine a port as a docking station or a harbor for ships. Just like a harbor provides a place for ships to stop, unload cargo, and pick up new items, 
 a computer port is a place where you can connect different devices, like a USB drive or a printer, to your computer. 
 It's like the port becomes a meeting point where information can be exchanged between your computer and these devices, much like a harbor where goods are exchanged between ships and the shore.

2.What does a port scanner send to a port to check the current status?
A port scanner sends a network request to connect to a specific TCP or UDP port on a computer and records the response.


3.When a port scanner sends a request to connect, what are the three possible responses? Describe them.
Open, Accepted: The computer responds and asks if there is anything it can do for you.
Closed, Not Listening: The computer responds that “This port is currently in use and unavailable at this time.”
Filtered, Dropped, Blocked: The computer doesn’t even bother to respond.


4.What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
TCP and UDP are the two most common protocols in use for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a nice orderly transaction protocol: TCP sends each packet in order, complete with error checking, verification, and a 3-way handshake to confirm each packet is successful.

UDP doesn’t have any error checking but tends to be faster. Live streaming and online video games often use UDP for this reason. 
UDP is a connectionless protocol, so programs that use UDP just send the data – and if you miss a packet, you will never get it again.
