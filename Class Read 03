CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes

What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block, which is simply a range of IP addresses. 
When you create a network, the aim is to make sure there are enough available IP addresses for your use case, 
without making the CIDR block too large and wasteful.

How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
An IPv4 (version 4 of IP) address is usually represented as four 8-bit decimal numbers or octets separated by dots, for example 127.0.0.1 

Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?

An octet, in the context of networking and IP addresses, refers to an 8-bit binary number. 
In terms of decimal representation, an octet can represent numbers from 0 to 255 inclusive (2^8 = 256 possible values).

For example:

The smallest value in an octet is 0 (binary: 00000000).
The largest value in an octet is 255 (binary: 11111111).


What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?

In IPv4 addressing, the number after the "/" in CIDR notation represents the prefix length or subnet mask of the IP address. 
This number specifies the number of significant bits in the network portion of the address.

How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
For the block 10.0.0.0/24:

The 10.0.0.0 represents the network address.
The /24 means the first 24 bits are for the network.

 So, in a /24 CIDR block, there are 256 total addresses, with 254 usable addresses for hosts.

What Is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters?

Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller, isolated sections or segments. 
Each segment is created to have its own unique set of resources and access controls, allowing organizations to control the flow of traffic, 
limit access to sensitive data, and enhance security measures.
This strategy essentially partitions a network to prevent unauthorized access and contain potential security breaches or threats.


In your own words, describe network segmentation.
Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?

While a well-configured firewall is essential for controlling incoming and outgoing traffic at the network perimeter. 
Network segmentation provides an additional layer of security by compartmentalizing the network and controlling access internally, Both are important components.

What is a screened subnet?
A screened subnet, often referred to as a "demilitarized zone" (DMZ), is a network architecture setup that adds an extra layer of security between an organization's internal network (intranet) 
and the external network (internet). It involves the use of multiple firewalls to create a buffer zone between the trusted internal network and the untrusted external network.

Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?

Those are examples of physical security measures. They're designed to restrict access to physical spaces or resources, 
ensuring only authorized individuals can enter or interact with specific areas or items.
