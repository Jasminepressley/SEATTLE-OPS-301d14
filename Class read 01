Layers of OSI Model

1. What does “OSI” stand for? OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.

2. List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for.
-Physical Layer
-Data Link Layer
-Network Layer
-Transport Layer
-Session Layer
-Presentation Layer
-Application Layer

3. Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?

The lower layers, which are often considered as the "hardware layers," focus more on the physical aspects of data transmission:

-Physical Layer: This is the actual hardware layer that deals with the physical transmission of data over a communication channel. 
It includes devices like cables, connectors, switches, hubs, and network interface cards (NICs).

-Data Link Layer: Found between the physical layer and the network layer, this layer manages the flow of data over the physical layer. 
It includes protocols that govern how devices access the physical network, such as Ethernet. 
It deals with MAC addresses and error detection and correction at the bit level.

The upper layers are often considered as the "software layers" and are more concerned with the logical aspects of data communication:

-Network Layer: This layer focuses on routing and forwarding data packets between different networks. 
It deals with logical addressing (IP addresses), routing protocols, and managing traffic congestion.

-Transport Layer: Responsible for ensuring the reliable transmission of data between devices. 
It manages end-to-end communication, provides error-checking, and handles issues like flow control and data segmentation.

-Session Layer: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections (sessions) between applications. 
It controls the dialogues (sessions) between computers by synchronizing communication and managing data exchange.

-Presentation Layer: This layer deals with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between systems. 
It translates data from the application layer into a format that the network can understand.

-Application Layer: The topmost layer interacts directly with the end-user and provides network services to applications. 
It includes protocols used for tasks like email, file transfer, and web browsing.

4. How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?

The OSI model helps troubleshoot by organizing network issues into seven layers, When something goes wrong:

-Identify the Layer: Figure out which layer of the seven-layer model is likely causing the problem.

-Focus on That Layer: Concentrate your efforts on that specific layer to fix the issue.

-Step-by-Step Approach: Work through the layers one by one, starting from the top, to find and solve the problem.

-Common Language: It gives everyone involved in fixing the issue a common way to talk about where the problem might be without getting too technical.

-Confirm the Fix: After addressing the problem, make sure to validate the solution at that specific layer to ensure it's resolved.


1.What Is Wireshark and How Is It Used?
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet.


2.What is a packet?
Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network.

3. What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish? How could these be used for nefarious purposes? For benevolent purposes?
-Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic – quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.

-Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.

-Visualization: Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.
