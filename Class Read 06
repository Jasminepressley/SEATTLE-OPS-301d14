What is the main purpose for implementing NAT on a network?

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts. 
Also, it does the translation of port numbers i.e. masks the port number of the host with another port number, in the packet that will be routed to the destination. 
It then makes the corresponding entries of IP address and port number in the NAT table. NAT generally operates on a router or firewall. 

At what layer of the OSI model does NAT happen?

Network Address Translation (NAT) typically operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. 
It involves the translation of IP addresses between private (local) and public (global) networks, allowing multiple devices in a local network to share a single public IP address when accessing the internet.
NAT helps in conserving public IP addresses and adds a layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.

What happens to packets when NAT runs out of addresses in the pool of available IPs?

When NAT runs out of available addresses in its pool:

-New devices might be denied access or experience connection issues.
-Existing connections might continue but new ones might not be established.
-Some systems might recycle unused IPs or require manual intervention to expand the pool of available addresses.

What disadvantage does using NAT pose for routers

Disadvantage of NAT:
 
-Translation results in switching path delays. 
-Certain applications will not function while NAT is enabled. 
-Complicates tunneling protocols such as IPsec. 
-Also, the router being a network layer device, should not tamper with port numbers(transport layer) but it has to do so because of NAT.
