What is NGINX?

NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. 
It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, 
NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

What are some common use cases for NGINX?

NGINX is commonly used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to manage incoming traffic and distribute it to slower upstream servers – anything from legacy database servers to microservices.

How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?

NGINX also is frequently placed between clients and a second web server, to serve as an SSL/TLS terminator or web accelerator. 
Acting as an intermediary, NGINX efficiently handles tasks that might slow down your web server, such as negotiating SSL/TLS or compressing and caching content to improve performance. 
Dynamic sites, built using anything from Node.js to PHP, commonly deploy NGINX as a content cache and reverse proxy to reduce load on application servers and make the most effective use of the underlying hardware.

Describe, as if to a non-technical friend how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might chooose to use it.

Think of NGINX as a traffic cop for the internet. When you go to a website, your browser sends a request to a server asking for the web page. 
NGINX helps handle these requests efficiently, making sure that the right information gets to your browser quickly and smoothly.
